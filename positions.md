I am always looking for motivated and curious new students to join my lab. If
you are interested in inventing techniques and tools to help developers write
better software, feel free to drop me an email and apply to our PhD program.
Please make sure to browse through our more recent published papers before
emailing me, and make sure to include your thoughts on one of these papers in
your email.
